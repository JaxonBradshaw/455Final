# 455Final
Final Project for Predictive Data Analytics. Goal of project is to take different sneakers and predict whether they will be a good purchase for buying and reselling them later. Project scrapes a bunch of shoes, bins and adjusts some of the data, performs text and image analytics, and creates a model for recommending shoes.
